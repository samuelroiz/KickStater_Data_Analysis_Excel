# KickStater_Data_Analysis_Excel
Data Analyst on Excel projects to determine if they are successful nor fail. Measuring the success on Kickstart.
Create tables, graphs, color shades, etc. 
## Background

Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

  The given data, we can state that the theater is the most popular category with a high success rate of 60.2 percent. The highest funded percentage for categories is technology and it makes up 69.7 percent of the total funding. Finally, the most popular sub-category is plays with a successful rate of 65.1 percent, and a fail rate of 33.1 percent.

  The limitations of this dataset is knowing why they failed or successful even though they get the funds. Not enough indicators to determine if it fails or successful because it could have been the lack of advertisement, workers, story, etc. If we are given more indicators or variables to determine its success, then we would have less limitations of the given dataset. 

  Some other possible tables and graphs we could make are the percentage of success and fail rate. Certain categories and sub-categories can show data on what category or sub-category is going to have a greater chance to be successful. For an example, there are about 2,185 out of 4,114 that are successful of reaching their funds. This number tells us that it has a successful rate of 53.1 percent. The failed rate is 37.2%  meaning 1,530 has failed. Also, the category theater has a successful rate of 60.2 percent (839/1393) and a fail rate of 35.4 percent. Another table would be graphs and tables of the percent funded for each category and sub-category. In the graphs, we can see each category and sub-category has received the most funds.

  The average of backer counts is 113 and the median is 25 which is dramatically different. This tells us that there is a huge gap between the amount of supporters with all of the kick starters. It also tells us that there will be a some kick starters that are more successful since those highly successful kick starters will impact its outcome of the data.
